## Git repository for ALSPAC 'Predictors of RSBB' analysis code (B3911)

This repository contains four Stata .do files; the first of which processes the raw data
ready for analysis, the second one contains the G0 mothers analyses, the third analyses
the G0 partner/father data, and the final one analyses the G1 child data.

Each of the three analysis files performs an 'exposome-wide association study' (ExWAS)
exploring associations between three broad categories of exposures (socioeconomic/material 
security factors, psychological/cognitive measures, and demographic variables) and various
religious/spiritual beliefs and behaviours outcomes (belief in God/divine power, religious
affiliation, attendance at church/place of worship, intrinsic religiosity, extrinsic
religiosity and total DUREL religiosity score).

In addition to a log file, these scripts also save out most of the results used in the
tables of the paper and creates plots of the results.

Note that ALSPAC data access is through a system of managed open access. Information
about access to ALSPAC data is given on the ALSPAC website 
(http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/access/). These datasets used in these
scripts are linked to ALSPAC project number B3911; if you are interested in accessing
these datasets, please quote this number during your application.
