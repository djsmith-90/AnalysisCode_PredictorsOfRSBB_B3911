## Git repository for ALSPAC 'Predictors of RSBB' analysis code (B3911)

This repository contains five Stata .do files:
 - "B3911_RSBB_PredictorsOfRSBB_DataCleaning.do" processes the raw data ready for analysis
 - "B3911_RSBB_PredictorsOfRSBB_G0MotherAnalysis.do" is the G0 mothers analyses for demographic and SEP variables
 - "B3911_RSBB_PredictorsOfRSBB_G0PartnerAnalysis.do" is the G0 partners/fathers analyses for demographics and SEP
 - "B3911_RSBB_PredictorsOfRSBB_G1Analysis.do" is the G1 child analyses for demographics and SEP
 - "B3911_RSBB_PredictorsOfRSBB_cognitive.do" is the analysis file for the cognitive/psychological variables (G0 and G1 combined)

Each of the analysis files performs analyses exploring associations between the broad categories of exposures 
noted above (demographic and socioeconomic/material security factors in one set of scripts, and psychological/cognitive 
factors in another) and various religious/spiritual beliefs and behaviours outcomes (belief in God/divine power, 
religious affiliation and attendance at church/place of worship).

In addition to a log file, these scripts also save out most of the results used in the
tables of the paper and creates plots of the results.

Note that ALSPAC data access is through a system of managed open access. Information
about access to ALSPAC data is given on the ALSPAC website 
(http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/access/). These datasets used in these
scripts are linked to ALSPAC project number B3911; if you are interested in accessing
these datasets, please quote this number during your application.
